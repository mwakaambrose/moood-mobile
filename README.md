# moood-mobile
This is the mobile app for the moood app ecosystem, just like the rest, its free and open source
## Installation
git clone this repository,
```bash 
~$ cd moood-mobile
~$ yarn install
~$ yarn run android
```

Enjoy. Contributions are welcome. Note that am no expert in mobile app development, 
leave alone react native, as a matter of fact these app are my first attempt to fully nodejs
powered applications.
Go easy on the issue creations.

## Screens
Here are some of the screenshots of how the app looks. These were taken when the app was under developement
